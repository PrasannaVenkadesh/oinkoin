- Backup Error Handling: Added notifications for automatic backup write failures, e.g., after app reinstall. Manual deletion of old backups may be needed. There are no problems in restoring from a backup instead.
- Improved Backup Timing: Automatic backups now trigger only after 1 hour, providing a window to restore data after accidental changes.
- Enhanced Backup Triggers: Automatic backups now run after restoring the app from suspension, not just at startup.
- Bug Fixes: General improvements and issue resolutions.
